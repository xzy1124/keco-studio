-- Migration: Fix collaborator invite permissions for admin and editor roles
-- Created: 2026-01-13
-- Purpose: Allow admin and editor roles to invite new collaborators
-- 
-- Current Issue: Only project owners can add collaborators
-- Solution: Update INSERT policy to allow admin and editor roles to add collaborators
--
-- Permission Rules (from requirements):
-- - admin: can invite as admin, editor, or viewer
-- - editor: can invite as editor or viewer (NOT admin)
-- - viewer: can only invite as viewer
-- - All invitations are checked at application level (API route)

-- Drop existing INSERT policy

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "collaborators_insert_policy" ON public.project_collaborators;

-- ============================================================================
-- Create new INSERT policy that allows admin and editor to add collaborators
-- ============================================================================

CREATE POLICY "collaborators_insert_policy"
  ON public.project_collaborators FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    -- User is the project owner
